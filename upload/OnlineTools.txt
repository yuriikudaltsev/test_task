You can set how many elemenents get generated per depth level. You can alo set if the generator should always use that many elements per depth level, or if it can choose to generate from 0 to max elements per depth level. Then this randomizer lets you choose allowed JSON data types. You can choose if you want to generate booleans, numbers, strings, arrays and objects. Then you can choose the source of string generation. It can be English words or it can be completely random characters.
